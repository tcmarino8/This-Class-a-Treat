# FINAL PRPOJECt

The final assignment is very free formed, so I will begin brainstorming here:
 
 3/9/2023:
    Thoughts are looking at locations with the most citations, and identify where to put new parking structures or add stops to public transport or other solutions.
     
3/21/2023:
    More thoughts are to look both bus routes and bart routes and compare look at where the most highly trafficd stops are. See if we can optimize bus routes and focus on their transport of people in and around bart stops. See about catchment areas of stops, what businesses are around them...

    Those before were potential individaul projects. Now we have teamed up wiht Alex Brown to map the bay area delta as a network and make some connections with the content we have been learning(Betweeness, clustering...). At this point I will begin importing some potential data. The first one comes from CA.gov open data portal. It is titled: dem_bay_delta_10m_20180615.tfw Not sure what this data site is, but this link has valuable images and other things https://data.ca.gov/dataset/san-francisco-bay-and-sacramento-san-joaquin-delta-dem-for-modeling-version-4-superseded/resource/0e1f4226-b797-4dfa-a4cf-0e701dcf396d?inner_span=True

   The project is now complete. It was an absolute pleasure working with Alex Brown on such a collaborative and inspiring project. It pushed us out of our comfort zone, taking what we learned in class and testing our creativity and ability. We chose the topic of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta conveyance project for the ability to create our own network, which we would then be able to explore and understand the area better. Throughout, we were exposed to topics and ideas beyond the class. We found readings from UT Austin studying deltas as networks and trying to understand connectivity and interactions of features in the network(link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169555X16301593). Alex attended the California Water and Environment Modeling Forum where he was exposed to the future possibilities in the field of study. He is now working as a project coordinator and web designer for Laurel Larson under her project relating to the delta.
   Without this project, we would not have been able to work so closely with an issue not only so close to our home in Berkeley, but also very close to our goals and aspirations to work with environmental process especially relating to water flow and snow pack melt. In a time of extreme weather, there is so much to learn and attempt to understand. Furthering this project I would like to see how I can model rivers in general as networks and see how a network representation may help predict events such as flood and water polution.
   Without further adoo, my project(a paper, a website, and my notebook) will all be in this repository along with notes and preliminary work.
