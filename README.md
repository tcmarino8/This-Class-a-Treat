Data science for urban systems

This was a project to view and analyze US census data in San Diego. I use pandas dataframes, kmeans clustering to analyze how tracts change over a two year period. This was cool, but I faced a major obsticle when I was unable to analyze the population of hispanics in the community. I can say with confidence that the rich did get richer(see Assignment 3.2 PDF)
