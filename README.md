The final assignment is very free formed, so I will begin brainstorming here:
 
 3/9/2023:
    Thoughts are looking at locations with the most citations, and identify where to put new parking structures or add stops to public transport or other solutions.
     
3/21/2023:
    More thoughts are to look both bus routes and bart routes and compare look at where the most highly trafficd stops are. See if we can optimize bus routes and focus on their transport of people in and around bart stops. See about catchment areas of stops, what businesses are around them...
