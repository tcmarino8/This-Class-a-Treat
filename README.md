# FINAL PRPOJECt

The final assignment is very free formed, so I will begin brainstorming here:
 
 3/9/2023:
    Thoughts are looking at locations with the most citations, and identify where to put new parking structures or add stops to public transport or other solutions.
     
3/21/2023:
    More thoughts are to look both bus routes and bart routes and compare look at where the most highly trafficd stops are. See if we can optimize bus routes and focus on their transport of people in and around bart stops. See about catchment areas of stops, what businesses are around them...

3/21/2023:
    Those before were potential individaul projects. Now we have teamed up wiht Alex Brown to map the bay area delta as a network and make some connections with the content we have been learning(Betweeness, clustering...). At this point I will begin importing some potential data. The first one comes from CA.gov open data portal. It is titled: dem_bay_delta_10m_20180615.tfw Not sure what this data site is, but this link has valuable images and other things https://data.ca.gov/dataset/san-francisco-bay-and-sacramento-san-joaquin-delta-dem-for-modeling-version-4-superseded/resource/0e1f4226-b797-4dfa-a4cf-0e701dcf396d?inner_span=True
